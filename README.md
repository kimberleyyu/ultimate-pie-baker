ultimate-pie-baker
==================

A pie-baking mini-game created by Kimberley Yu and Jordan Lee.
Spring 2013

Uses the GridWorld case study framework.
After opening the game with GridWorld, you can select one of 3 difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard.
Playing as the basket, you can move around the grid to any adjacent spots via a mouse click.
The goal is to collect all of the ingredients to bake an apple pie (flour, sugar, butter, and apples) before the randomly moving ants eat them all.
